## About Me

I am a mathematics student interested in the theoretical foundations of modern machine learning.  
Rather than focusing solely on predictive performance, my work investigates the structural and geometric mechanisms that govern model behavior.

I am particularly driven by questions such as:
- *What caused the model to act this way?*
- *Under what assumptions can this behavior be expected to generalize?*
